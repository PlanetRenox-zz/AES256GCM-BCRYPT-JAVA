AES256-GCM Implementation with BCRYPT private key generation written with pure Java for text encryption using a password.

I wrote this code in college from scratch for a website I was working on that offered text encryption + text storage.
The website was completed, but I saw no point in keeping it alive with a million other websites offering encrypted text storage. 

However I thought I should put up this portion of the code separately because I remember at the time I could not find any other AES Java implementations that made use of BCRYPT for key generation. 

This was the first ever project I wrote code for so I did not follow the typical conventions. 
Email me if you have questions. I'd love to revisit the subject.
